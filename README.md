Assignment Topic: Implementation and Demonstration of Linked List and Stack

Description:

This assignment involves building a simple Java program to demonstrate the implementation and operation of two fundamental data structures:

- Singly Linked List  
- Stack (using Linked List)

The objective is to practice key operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, sorting (for linked lists), and LIFO behavior (for stacks), and understand how they behave internally.

Features Implemented:

Linked List:
- Insert at the beginning, end, and any position  
- Delete from the beginning, end, and any position  
- Sort the list in ascending order  
- Insert data into a sorted list  
- Display current list elements  

Stack:
- Push (insert)  
- Pop (remove top)  
- Peek (view top element)  
- Check if stack is empty  
- Nicely formatted stack display  

How to Run:

1. Compile all .java files in the execution package.  
2. Create a main method to call and test stack or linked list operations.  
3. Example usage:

   Stack s = new Stack();  
   s.push(10);  
   s.push(5);  
   s.display(); // Show stack from top to bottom  

Notes:

- All logic was developed manually without using Java built-in data structure libraries.  
- The code includes custom error messages and console formatting for better clarity during runtime.
